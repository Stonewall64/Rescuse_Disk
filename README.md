<h1>Open Source Rescue Disk</h1>
<p>When I began my career in IT, I quickly learned there are many ways to solve a single problem. 
  If you ask two different IT professionals how to fix Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), I guarantee each person will have a unique methodology on how to diagnose and resolve that issue. 
  When fixing an issue, just like fixing any issue, you require tools. Every IT person I have worked with or met has their own unique toolset they use to resolve tickets and other
  malfunctioning devices. </p>
  <p>This repository contains some of the tools I have used in my own personal "rescue disk" to solve my own problems and the problems of others. The majority of this is open source 
  software. I do not own any of the software or claim to own any unless I explicitly say that I do. Some of the software has paid versions and I encourage the monetary contribution to 
  these creators to assist them financially.</p>
  <p>I hope you find a starting point in the realm of IT support in this repository. Please feel free to fork this and add to it as needed. The concept of a Rescue Disk is not a new one,
  so I only ask that you use this software for good. Help those who need help. Pass along your knowledge of technology to give another human being calmness in the face of catastrophe.</p>
